The objective of this activity was to make a function for the discord bot that would return a sentence and to generate this sentence it would use data from the web scraping done with the !crawl function. The activity was not very complex to be done, but it was laborious. For some reason, when loading any of the models, several warnings appear, but I don't know what they mean. You can remove them using the ```export TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL=2``` command in the terminal.
